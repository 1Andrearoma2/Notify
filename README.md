# Know the title and author of the song you are listening to

If it bothers you too every time you turn the page to find out the title we are currently listening to, then this is the program for you! This little script in Python through the spotipy library every time the song you are listening to changes sends you a notification with the name of the song and the author.
Unfortunately I couldn't find a method to also show the album cover because the library I use to show the notification can't read it.

# How to use it
When you launch the program a Spotify page will open on your default browser asking you to allow connecting your Spotify account with the application like this:

Click agree and that's it, now the app will do everything and you just need to have a Spotify session open.
